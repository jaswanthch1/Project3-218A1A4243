            <h2>MINI Cooper price</h2>
            <p>The iconic Mini Cooper is a stylish and premium compact hatch, renowned for its excellent handling and 
                aggressive performance. With a fun driving experience, lots of customisation options, and the latest tech, 
                it's perfect for those in search of a unique and sporty car.

            </p>
            <p>What makes the Cooper special is the iconic styling that has been retained over the years. The combination of the Mini Cooper’s powerful engine, quick steering and splendid dynamics has what it takes to paste a wide smile on your face. But one must remember, it isn’t the most practical and makes sense if it is your second car.
